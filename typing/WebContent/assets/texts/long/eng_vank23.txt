Independence Hall, Place of the Korean Spirit
Independence Hall shows the essence of the Korean Spirit, which has remained in the hearts of the Korean people throughout Korea's 5000 years of history.
The March 1st Independence Movement is a representative example that demonstrates how Koreans overcame challenges.
On March 1, 1919, numerous Koreans took to the streets to protest Japanese occupation.
Cheonan, the location of the Independence Hall, is where the famous freedom fighter, Ryu Gwansun (1902-1920), participated in protests for independence.
