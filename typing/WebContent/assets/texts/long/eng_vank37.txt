Mul-naengmyeon Chilled Buckwheat Noodle Soup
Mul-naengmyeon, made with buckwheat noodles in chilled broth, is one of the most popular dishes during hot summer.
People living in the northern region mainly enjoyed this, since buckwheat is mostly produced there.
Mul-naengmyeon has been particularly famous in Pyeongyang (capital of North Korea) during winter.
