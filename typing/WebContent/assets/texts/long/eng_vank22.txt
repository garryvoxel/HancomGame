Hwaseong Fortress, Expression of Desire for Change
Hwaseong Fortress represents King Jeongjo's (1752-1800) desire for change.
In 1789, King Jeongjo moved the tomb of his father, who died tragically, to Suwon, and built Hwaseong Fortress to develop Suwon into a new town.
The fortress was built by combining traditional construction techniques and new scientific knowledge.
It shows excellence in its military defense function and unique architecture.
