Incheon Open Port, Historic Port of Joseon
Incheon Open Port was opened during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).
By opening this port in 1883, Joseon began to actively engage in international trade.
Its opening was forced by Japan to serve the interest of foreign powers, including Japan.
Today, Incheon hosts the Incheon Port and the Incheon International Airport that connects the world.
Incheon has become a hub of international trade and exchange.
